Once we find the desired shape and it is approved by the client, we will then move onto the tattoo outlining process without numbing. After the outline, the client will be numbed for 15 minutes before moving onto the shading process.",

    "moreInfo": "Saline tattoo removal is a safe, natural, chemical-free (no acid) method of removing tattoos using a saline solution and traditional tattooing equipment. This method is less painful/abrasive, gentler on the skin, and faster healing duration than laser removal. It can remove almost any color by lifting the pigment out of the dermis, up through the epidermis, then forming a scab that exfoliates with pigment in it. Saline also removes black discoloration caused by the laser. This may take up to 3-6 sessions depending on how dark the previous tattoo was and what the desired results are.",
