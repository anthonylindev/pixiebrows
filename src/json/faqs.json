  {
    "question": "Is a touch-up session required?",
    "answer": "All semi-permanent makeup procedures are a 2-step process. The initial touch-up after your first session is required because it is the perfecting session. Since your brows will heal 30-40% lighter (sometimes more depending on your skin type, but this is normal) and soften up, we can darken, define, and go over any minor changes you desire during your appointment. This touch-up session will also help your brows last longer. This is where the real magic happens."

    "question": "After the touch-up how often should I come in?",

  },
  {
    "question": "What should I expect during the procedure? (Virgin brow set)",
    "answer": "When you come in, I will clean up your brows with a disposable razor if it’s not cleaned already. After, I will shape one brow first with a pencil to see what you like or don’t like about the shape. Once you’re satisfied with the shape, I will then shape the second brow the same. I will save as much brow hair as possible within your desired shape to keep it as natural as possible. After that, I will outline your brows without numbing cream. Once I’m done outlining your brows, I’ll numb your brows for 15 minutes before shading in both of your brows. Numbing gel can be reapplied as needed throughout the process. Once I’m done shading, we will take pictures and we are done!"
  },
  {
    "question": "What should I expect after my procedure?",
    "answer": "You may experience swelling and redness, but it will subside. Your brows will start to darken, crack, and peel between 3-7 days. Your new brows will be what is underneath the scab. If you don't see pigment underneath when your brows crack/peel, please be patient and wait until all of your brows are healed. They will slightly darken again. For the best results, it is important for you to follow the post-op instructions. Once everything is peeled, you may resume your normal routines and activities."
  },
  {
    "question": "What can I do to help my brows last longer?",
    "answer": "Sun exposure, facial exfoliation, and sun exposure can cause your brows to fade faster. Avoid these and apply sunscreen when you are out in the sun to prolong the life of your brows."
